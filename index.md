# BIO 
My name is Kamalavasan, and I am a computer scientist focusing on accelerator architectures and programming models for generating and utilizing accelerators. Currently, I work as a computer scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. I obtained my PhD in computer science from the University of Warwick. My doctoral research aimed to bridge the gap between achieving better performance on FPGAs and ease of their programming. I achieved this by developing a high-level workflow to target FPGAs for structured mesh-based numerical algorithms. This work has been published in highly ranked conferences such as the International Conference on Supercomputing and the International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium.

Before joining Warwick, I worked at Wave Computing as a Senior Engineer, where I designed test and machine learning applications for WaveComputingâ€™s massively parallel core processor architecture. I hold a BSc.Eng degree from the University of Moratuwa, majoring in electronic and telecommunication engineering. During my undergraduate studies, I completed several Verilog-based FPGA projects, which were also published in internationally recognized conferences. In addition to my experience with FPGAs, I have worked with GPUs (CUDA), multi-core CPUs (OpenMP, MPI), and Custom DPUs to accelerate applications.
